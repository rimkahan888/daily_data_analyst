Absolutely! You’re spot on. **ABC analysis can indeed be applied from multiple angles**, including identifying **top customers** and **top-selling products** (or services). These are two of the most common and impactful use cases for ABC analysis in business and data analytics. Let’s break down how each angle works, why they matter, and how they drive decision-making:

---

### **1. ABC Analysis for Customers**  
**Purpose**: Identify which customers contribute the most value (e.g., revenue, profit) to prioritize retention, personalize engagement, and allocate resources effectively.  

**How It Works**:  
- **Class A Customers**: Top 20% of customers driving ~80% of revenue.  
- **Class B Customers**: Next 30% contributing ~15% of revenue.  
- **Class C Customers**: Bottom 50% contributing ~5% of revenue.  

**Example**:  
- A SaaS company might analyze customer subscription fees:  
  - **Class A**: Enterprise clients paying $100k+/year.  
  - **Class B**: Mid-sized businesses paying $10k–$100k/year.  
  - **Class C**: Small businesses or freelancers paying <$10k/year.  

**Actionable Insights**:  
- **Class A**: Assign dedicated account managers, offer premium support, or upsell/cross-sell.  
- **Class B**: Nurture with targeted campaigns to move them into Class A.  
- **Class C**: Automate low-cost engagement (e.g., email newsletters) or phase out unprofitable accounts.  

**Why It Matters**:  
- Focuses efforts on high-value relationships, reduces churn risk for critical accounts, and improves ROI on customer success initiatives.

### **2. ABC Analysis for Products**  
**Purpose**: Determine which products generate the most value (e.g., sales, profit margin) to optimize inventory, pricing, and marketing strategies.  

**How It Works**:  
- **Class A Products**: Top 20% of products generating ~80% of sales.  
- **Class B Products**: Next 30% contributing ~15% of sales.  
- **Class C Products**: Bottom 50% contributing ~5% of sales.  

**Example**:  
- A retail store might analyze SKU-level sales:  
  - **Class A**: Best-selling electronics (e.g., smartphones, laptops).  
  - **Class B**: Accessories (e.g., chargers, cases).  
  - **Class C**: Niche items (e.g., phone screen protectors).  

**Actionable Insights**:  
- **Class A**: Stock heavily, promote aggressively, and negotiate bulk discounts with suppliers.  
- **Class B**: Test bundling with Class A products or run seasonal promotions.  
- **Class C**: Reduce stock levels, discontinue low-margin items, or sell via clearance.  

**Why It Matters**:  
- Optimizes inventory costs, minimizes stockouts for high-demand items, and aligns product strategy with revenue goals.

### **Other Angles for ABC Analysis**  
While customers and products are the most common, ABC analysis can also be applied to:  
- **Suppliers**: Focus on vendors critical to your supply chain (e.g., Class A suppliers provide 80% of raw materials).  
- **SKUs/Inventory**: Manage stock levels based on turnover rates.  
- **Marketing Channels**: Allocate budgets to high-performing channels (e.g., Class A: paid search, Class B: social media).  
- **Geographic Regions**: Prioritize markets driving the most sales.

### **Key Differences Between Customer vs. Product ABC Analysis**  
| **Aspect**               | **Customer ABC Analysis**          | **Product ABC Analysis**           |  
|--------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|  
| **Focus**                 | Customer lifetime value (CLV)     | Revenue/profit per product         |  
| **Key Metrics**           | Total spend, frequency, margins   | Sales volume, profit margins       |  
| **Primary Goal**          | Retention, loyalty, upselling     | Inventory optimization, promotion  |  
| **Tools**                 | CRM data, transaction history     | POS/sales data, inventory systems  |

### **How to Perform ABC Analysis for Both**  
1. **Define the Metric**:  
   - For customers: Total spend, profit, or engagement.  
   - For products: Sales volume, revenue, or margin.  
2. **Sort Items Descending**: Rank customers/products by the chosen metric.  
3. **Calculate Cumulative Contribution**:  
   - Cumulative % = (Running total of metric / Total metric) × 100.  
4. **Assign Classes**:  
   - **A**: Until cumulative % reaches ~80%.  
   - **B**: Next ~15% (cumulative 80–95%).  
   - **C**: Remaining ~5% (cumulative 95–100%).  
5. **Visualize**: Use Pareto charts to highlight the "vital few."  

**Example Python Code for Product ABC Analysis**:  
```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample data
data = {'Product': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'I', 'J'],
        'Revenue': [5000, 4000, 3000, 2000, 1000, 800, 600, 400, 200, 100]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Sort by revenue (descending)
df = df.sort_values(by='Revenue', ascending=False)

# Calculate cumulative percentage
df['Cumulative_Revenue'] = df['Revenue'].cumsum()
total_revenue = df['Revenue'].sum()
df['Cumulative_Percent'] = (df['Cumulative_Revenue'] / total_revenue) * 100

# Assign ABC classes
df['Class'] = 'C'
df.loc[df['Cumulative_Percent'] <= 80, 'Class'] = 'A'
df.loc[(df['Cumulative_Percent'] > 80) & (df['Cumulative_Percent'] <= 95), 'Class'] = 'B'

print(df)
```

### **Why Both Angles Matter**  
- **Holistic Insights**: Combining customer and product ABC analyses reveals synergies (e.g., Class A customers buying Class A products).  
- **Strategic Alignment**: Prioritizes efforts across sales, marketing, and operations.  
- **Resource Efficiency**: Avoids wasting time on low-impact customers or products.  

---

### **When to Be Cautious**  
- **Overlap**: A Class C customer might buy Class A products (don’t ignore them entirely!).  
- **Dynamic Data**: Re-run ABC analysis periodically (e.g., quarterly) as customer behavior and product performance evolve.  

---

### **Final Takeaway**  
Yes, you’re absolutely right! ABC analysis is a **flexible framework** that can (and should) be applied to **both customers and products** (and beyond). By doing so, analysts empower businesses to:  
1. **Focus on what truly drives value**.  
2. **Allocate resources strategically**.  
3. **Turn data into actionable priorities**.  

This dual-angle approach is a hallmark of effective data-driven decision-making.
