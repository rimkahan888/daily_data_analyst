### **Phase 1: Understand the Business Model**
**Context**: The startup sells subscription-based software online (e.g., $50/month/user). They’re struggling with cash flow, low growth, and high cancellations.  
**Goal**: Diagnose why they’re struggling and prioritize fixes.

### **Key Metrics to Analyze First**  
*(Prioritize survival-focused metrics)*  

1. **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)**  
   - **What to check**: Is MRR growing, flat, or declining?  
   - **Example**: If MRR is dropping, it means cancellations (churn) outweigh new subscriptions.  

2. **Churn Rate**  
   - **What to check**: High churn = customers leave quickly.  
   - **Example**: A 10% monthly churn means losing 10% of subscribers every month (unsustainable for growth).  

3. **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) vs. Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)**  
   - **What to check**: Is CAC > LTV? (If yes, they’re losing money per customer.)  
   - **Example**: Spending $200 to acquire a customer (CAC) who pays $50/month but cancels after 3 months (LTV = $150) = **$50 loss per customer**.  

4. **Cash Runway**  
   - **What to check**: How many months until they run out of cash?  
   - **Formula**: (Current cash) ÷ (Monthly expenses). If runway is < 6 months, urgent action needed.  

5. **Activation Rate**  
   - **What to check**: Are new users experiencing the product’s core value quickly?  
   - **Example**: Only 20% of free trial users complete onboarding → low activation = wasted leads.  

6. **Conversion Rate (Free to Paid)**  
   - **What to check**: % of free trial users who upgrade to paid plans.  
   - **Example**: A 5% conversion rate means 95% of trials don’t convert → poor product-market fit or pricing issues.  

7. **Gross Margin**  
   - **What to check**: Are they profitable per customer?  
   - **Example**: If hosting/support costs eat 80% of revenue, scaling will burn cash.

### **Phase 2: Diagnose the Problems**  
**Example Hypotheses Based on Data**:  
- **Problem 1**: High churn rate (15% monthly) → Customers aren’t satisfied or see no value.  
- **Problem 2**: CAC is 3x LTV → Marketing is too expensive or customers don’t stay long.  
- **Problem 3**: Low activation rate (20%) → Users don’t understand the product during trials.  
- **Problem 4**: Cash runway of 4 months → Need immediate cost-cutting or revenue boosts.

### **Phase 3: Recommend Next Steps**  
*(Prioritize quick wins first)*  

1. **Reduce Churn**  
   - Survey churned customers: *Why did you leave?*  
   - Fix onboarding: Simplify setup to help users see value faster.  
   - Offer discounts for annual plans (improves retention).  

2. **Optimize CAC**  
   - Pause expensive ad channels (e.g., Google Ads) if CAC > LTV.  
   - Focus on referrals or organic growth (e.g., content marketing).  

3. **Improve Activation**  
   - Add guided tutorials during free trials.  
   - Highlight “aha moments” (e.g., “Complete 3 tasks to see results”).
