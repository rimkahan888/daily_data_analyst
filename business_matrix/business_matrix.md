Here’s a list of **beginner-friendly business metrics** that are essential for data analysts to understand, along with simple descriptions:

1. **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**  
   *The average cost to acquire a new customer* (e.g., marketing expenses ÷ new customers).  

2. **Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)**  
   *Total revenue a business can expect from a single customer over their lifetime.*  

3. **Churn Rate**  
   *Percentage of customers who stop using a product/service over a period* (e.g., 10% monthly churn).  

4. **Conversion Rate**  
   *Percentage of users who complete a desired action* (e.g., 5% of website visitors make a purchase).  

5. **Retention Rate**  
   *Percentage of customers who continue using a product/service over time* (opposite of churn).  

6. **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)**  
   *Predictable revenue a business earns monthly* (common for subscriptions).  

7. **Gross Margin**  
   *Profit after subtracting product costs* (revenue - cost of goods sold).  

8. **Net Promoter Score (NPS)**  
   *Measures customer loyalty* (e.g., “How likely are you to recommend us?” scored 0-10).  

9. **Return on Investment (ROI)**  
   *Profitability of an investment* [(gain - cost) ÷ cost].  

10. **Inventory Turnover**  
    *How quickly inventory is sold and replaced* (e.g., high turnover = fast sales).

    *Percentage of visitors who leave a website without interacting* (e.g., 50% bounce rate).  

12. **Click-Through Rate (CTR)**  
    *Percentage of people who click on a link/ad* (clicks ÷ impressions).  

13. **Daily Active Users (DAU) / Monthly Active Users (MAU)**  
    *Measures user engagement* (e.g., 1,000 DAU means 1,000 users daily).  

14. **Cost Per Lead (CPL)**  
    *Average cost to generate a potential customer contact* (marketing spend ÷ leads).  

15. **Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)**
