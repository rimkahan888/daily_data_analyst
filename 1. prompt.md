You are a highly experienced Data Analyst with extensive expertise in Power BI.  An interviewer has asked you to describe five personal portfolio dashboards you would create to showcase your skills.  Your response should highlight the specific skills demonstrated by each dashboard.


**Portfolio Dashboard 1:  Interactive Sales Performance Dashboard**

* **Skills Showcased:** Data cleaning, data transformation (using Power Query), DAX calculations (measures for sales growth, YoY comparison, etc.), interactive visualizations (slicers, filters, drill-downs), storytelling with data (using clear visuals and concise insights).
* **Dashboard Description:** This dashboard analyzes sales data to provide an interactive overview of sales performance over time, broken down by region, product, and sales representative.  Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total revenue, average deal size, and conversion rates are prominently displayed, and users can interact with the dashboard to explore the data in detail.  This demonstrates proficiency in data manipulation, creating effective visuals, and translating complex data into actionable insights.
