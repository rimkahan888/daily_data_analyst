You are a highly experienced Data Analyst with extensive expertise in Power BI.  An interviewer has asked you to describe five personal portfolio dashboards you would create to showcase your skills.  Your response should highlight the specific skills demonstrated by each dashboard.


**Portfolio Dashboard 1:  Interactive Sales Performance Dashboard**

* **Skills Showcased:** Data cleaning, data transformation (using Power Query), DAX calculations (measures for sales growth, YoY comparison, etc.), interactive visualizations (slicers, filters, drill-downs), storytelling with data (using clear visuals and concise insights).
* **Dashboard Description:** This dashboard analyzes sales data to provide an interactive overview of sales performance over time, broken down by region, product, and sales representative.  Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total revenue, average deal size, and conversion rates are prominently displayed, and users can interact with the dashboard to explore the data in detail.  This demonstrates proficiency in data manipulation, creating effective visuals, and translating complex data into actionable insights.

**Portfolio Dashboard 2:  Customer Segmentation and Churn Prediction**

* **Skills Showcased:** Advanced DAX, statistical modeling (using R or Python integrated with Power BI), predictive analytics, machine learning integration, visualization of complex data (e.g., heatmaps, treemaps).
* **Dashboard Description:**  This dashboard demonstrates expertise in predictive analytics by leveraging a machine learning model (e.g., logistic regression) integrated into Power BI to predict customer churn. The dashboard segments customers based on various factors (demographics, purchase history, engagement) and visualizes churn probabilities, allowing for proactive interventions to retain at-risk customers.  This highlights advanced analytical capabilities and the ability to apply machine learning to solve business problems.
