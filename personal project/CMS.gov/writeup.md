Let’s refine your plan and estimate the size of the Inpatient Claims data when converted from a 42.5 MB CSV to Parquet, then outline how your pipeline using S3, DLT (data load tools), DuckDB, and pandas can transform it into a star schema (Silver layer) and specific data marts (Gold layer) for Power BI dashboards. We’ll assume your 100,000-row dataset stays the focus, and I’ll address your intent to showcase data analyst skills without diving too deep into unfinished thoughts at the end.

### Step 1: Estimating Parquet File Size
You’re right—S3 is foundational for scalable data storage, and Parquet is a smart choice over CSV due to its columnar format, compression, and query efficiency. Here’s how the size changes:

- **CSV Size**: ~42.5 MB (uncompressed, as calculated earlier: 100,000 rows × 444 bytes/row).
- **Parquet Conversion**:
  - Parquet uses columnar storage and compression (e.g., Snappy, Gzip). Compression ratios depend on data redundancy and types.
  - **Assumptions**:
    - Strings (IDs, codes): Moderate repetition (e.g., diagnosis codes like "428.0" repeat), good compression.
    - Dates: Fixed 8-byte strings, highly compressible.
    - Numerics (payments): Variable precision, less compression.
    - Avg ~5-10x reduction vs. CSV is typical for claims-like data.
  - **Estimate**: 
    - 42.5 MB ÷ 5 = ~8.5 MB (conservative).
    - 42.5 MB ÷ 10 = ~4.3 MB (aggressive).
    - Real-world Parquet files from similar datasets (e.g., DE-SynPUF samples) suggest ~20-30% of CSV size.
    - Likely range: **8-12 MB** with Snappy compression (default in many tools).

- **Conclusion**: Expect the Parquet file to be **~10 MB** for 100,000 rows. This is small enough to handle easily but realistic for pipeline practice.
