#### **Plan and Execution**

##### **1. Data Cleaning and Transformation**
- **Goal**: Prepare raw sales data for analysis by ensuring accuracy, consistency, and completeness.
- **Steps Taken**:
  - **Data Cleaning**:
    - Removed duplicate rows, erroneous entries, and outliers.
    - Standardized formats for dates, product names, and regional identifiers.
    - Resolved missing values using appropriate imputation techniques or exclusion where necessary.
  - **Data Transformation**:
    - Utilized **Power Query** to reshape the data:
      - Split, merge, and pivot columns for better usability.
      - Created calculated columns for metrics like `Net Sales`, `Profit`, and `Discount Percentage`.
    - Aggregated data at different levels (monthly, quarterly, yearly) to enable time-series analysis.
    - Created hierarchical structures for drill-down capabilities (e.g., Region → Sub-region → City → Store).

##### **2. DAX Calculations**
- **Goal**: Implement advanced calculations and measures to derive meaningful insights from the data.
- **Key Measures Created**:
  - **Total Revenue**: `SUM(Sales[Revenue])`
  - **YoY Growth**: `((Current Year Revenue - Previous Year Revenue) / Previous Year Revenue) * 100`
  - **Average Deal Size**: `DIVIDE(SUM(Sales[Revenue]), COUNT(Sales[Deal_ID]))`
  - **Conversion Rate**: `(SUM(Sales[Converted Deals]) / SUM(Sales[Leads])) * 100`
  - **Profit Margin (%)**: `(SUM(Sales[Profit]) / SUM(Sales[Revenue])) * 100`
- **Dynamic Metrics**:
  - Built measures to enable dynamic filtering based on time periods (e.g., Monthly, Quarterly, Yearly) and dimensions (e.g., Region, Product, Sales Representative).

##### **3. Interactive Visualizations**
- **Goal**: Create an intuitive and visually appealing dashboard to facilitate data exploration and storytelling.
- **Visuals Used**:
  - **KPIs**: Displayed prominently at the top of the dashboard for quick insights into Total Revenue, YoY Growth, and Conversion Rates.
  - **Line Chart**: Trends in sales revenue over time (monthly and yearly comparisons).
  - **Bar Chart**: Sales performance by region and product category.
  - **Funnel Chart**: Sales pipeline analysis, from leads generated to deals closed.
  - **Map Visualization**: Geographical distribution of sales, color-coded by revenue performance.
  - **Matrix Table**: Detailed breakdown of sales by product, region, and sales representative.
- **Interactivity**:
  - Added **slicers** for time periods, product categories, regions, and sales teams.
  - Enabled **drill-through** pages for deep dives into specific metrics (e.g., view sales trends for a specific product or sales rep).
  - Included **tooltips** with additional insights (e.g., total units sold, average discount applied).

##### **4. Storytelling with Data**
- **Goal**: Present complex data in a way that is easy to understand and actionable for stakeholders.
- **Approach**:
  - Designed the dashboard layout to follow the **"top-to-bottom" storytelling approach**:
    - **Top Level**: KPIs for quick, high-level insights.
    - **Middle Level**: Visualizations showing trends and comparisons.
    - **Lower Level**: Detailed tables and drill-downs for granular analysis.
  - Provided context using dynamic titles, annotations, and tooltips to explain insights (e.g., "YoY revenue growth slowed in Q3 due to seasonal factors").
