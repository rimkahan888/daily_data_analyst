Here‚Äôs how **churn rate**, **MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)**, and **ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue)** apply (or don‚Äôt) to your traditional retail apparel store scenario:

---

### **1. Churn Rate**  
**Definition**:  
The percentage of customers who stop purchasing over a period.  

**Applicability**:  
- **Yes**, but with adjustments!  
- **Retail churn** = Customers who haven‚Äôt purchased in 6+ months (or your chosen timeframe).  

**How to Calculate**:  
```sql  
-- Total active customers last year vs. inactive this year  
WITH active_customers_2022 AS (  
  SELECT DISTINCT customer_id  
  FROM fact_sales  
  WHERE year = 2022  
),  
inactive_customers_2023 AS (  
  SELECT DISTINCT customer_id  
  FROM fact_sales  
  WHERE year = 2023  
)  
SELECT  
  (COUNT(*) - COUNT(i.customer_id)) / COUNT(*) AS churn_rate  
FROM active_customers_2022 a  
LEFT JOIN inactive_customers_2023 i ON a.customer_id = i.customer_id;  
```  

**Example**:  
- 1,000 customers bought in 2022.  
- 700 didn‚Äôt return in 2023.  
- **Churn rate = 70%** (critical for loyalty program design).

### **2. MRR/ARR**  
**Definition**:  
- **MRR**: Predictable monthly revenue (common in subscriptions).  
- **ARR**: Annualized version of MRR.  

**Applicability**:  
- **No**, unless you have a subscription model (e.g., monthly apparel boxes).  
- Traditional retail relies on **one-time transactions**, not recurring revenue.  

**Alternative Metrics**:  
- **Average Transaction Value (ATV)**: `Total Revenue / Total Transactions`.  
- **Repeat Purchase Rate**: % of customers who buy again.  
- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**: Total revenue from a customer over their lifespan.  

**Example**:  
```sql  
-- Repeat Purchase Rate  
SELECT  
  COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS total_customers,  
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN purchase_count > 1 THEN customer_id END) AS repeat_customers,  
  repeat_customers / total_customers AS repeat_rate  
FROM (  
  SELECT customer_id, COUNT(DISTINCT transaction_id) AS purchase_count  
  FROM fact_sales  
  GROUP BY customer_id  
);  
```

### **3. What‚Äôs More Relevant for Retail?**  
#### **a. ABC Analysis**  
- **Inventory**: Classify SKUs into A (top 20% revenue), B, C (clearance).  
- **Customers**: Identify top 20% spenders (Gold-tier) driving 80% of sales.  

#### **b. Key Metrics**:  
| Metric                  | Formula/Example                          | Purpose                           |  
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|  
| **Inventory Turnover**  | `Units Sold / Average Inventory`         | Avoid overstocking swimwear.      |  
| **Sell-Through Rate**   | `Units Sold / Initial Stock √ó 100`       | Track seasonal item performance.  |  
| **Gross Margin**        | `(Revenue - COGS) / Revenue √ó 100`       | Profitability per product.        |  

---

### **When MRR/ARR Might Apply**  
If your apparel store launches a **subscription service** (e.g., monthly athleisure boxes), then:  
- **MRR** = Number of subscribers √ó Average monthly fee.  
- **Churn Rate** = % of subscribers canceling monthly.  

Otherwise, stick to **transactional metrics** (ATV, CLV) and **inventory metrics** (turnover, ABC classes).

---

### **Practical Example**  
A customer buys $200 worth of products in January but doesn‚Äôt return all year:  
- **CLV** = $200 (unless they return).  
- **Churn** = Marked as "churned" after 6 months of inactivity.  
- **MRR/ARR** = Irrelevant (no subscription).  

Focus on **customer retention campaigns** (e.g., email discounts for inactive customers) and **inventory clearance** (C-class items).

---

### **Conclusion**  
- **Use**: Churn rate (retail-adjusted), CLV, ABC analysis.  
- **Avoid**: MRR/ARR (unless subscriptions exist).  
- **Retail ‚â† SaaS**: Focus on transactional behavior and inventory health.  

This approach ensures you‚Äôre tracking metrics that actually drive decisions in traditional retail! üõçÔ∏èüìä
