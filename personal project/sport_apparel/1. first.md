### **Case Study: Inventory Optimization for a Sports Apparel Retailer in Florida**  
**Industry Context**: 10 physical stores in Florida selling sports apparel (e.g., swimwear, running gear, golf attire).  
**Key Challenges**:  
1. Overstocking low-demand seasonal items (e.g., winter jackets in a warm climate).  
2. Inconsistent inventory allocation across stores (e.g., Miami store sells more swimwear, Orlando store needs more golf apparel).

### **Improvement 1: Seasonal Demand Forecasting with Climate-Based Adjustments**  
#### **Methodology**  
1. **Analyze Historical Sales by Product Category**:  
   Use `dim_time` and `dim_product` to identify seasonal trends specific to Florida’s climate (e.g., swimwear sells year-round but peaks in summer).  
   ```sql  
   -- Monthly sales for swimwear vs. "winter" gear  
   SELECT  
     t.month,  
     SUM(CASE WHEN p.category = 'Swimwear' THEN f.units_sold ELSE 0 END) AS swimwear_sales,  
     SUM(CASE WHEN p.category = 'Outerwear' THEN f.units_sold ELSE 0 END) AS outerwear_sales  
   FROM fact_sales f  
   JOIN dim_product p ON f.product_id = p.product_id  
   JOIN dim_time t ON f.time_id = t.time_id  
   GROUP BY t.month;  
   ```  
   **Insight**:  
   - Swimwear sales peak in **June** (1,200 units) but remain steady in winter (300 units/month).  
   - Outerwear sells only 50 units/month year-round (irrelevant for Florida).  

2. **Adjust Forecasts for Local Climate**:  
   Use a **time-series model** (e.g., Prophet in Python) to predict demand, incorporating Florida’s weather data (e.g., temperature, tourism trends).  
   ```python  
   # Python Code: Swimwear demand forecast with weather data  
   import pandas as pd  
   from prophet import Prophet  

   # Merge sales data with Miami temperature data  
   df = pd.merge(sales_data, weather_data, on='date')  
   df = df[['date', 'swimwear_units_sold', 'avg_temp_F']]  

   # Fit model  
   model = Prophet()  
   model.add_regressor('avg_temp_F')  
   model.fit(df)  

   # Predict next 6 months  
   future = model.make_future_dataframe(periods=180)  
   future['avg_temp_F'] = [85, 87, 90, 88, 82, 80]  # Example Miami forecast  
   forecast = model.predict(future)  
   ```  
   **Output**:  
   - Increase swimwear stock by **20%** in June.  
   - Reduce outerwear orders by **90%** and replace with UV-protection gear (e.g., hats, sunglasses).  

#### **Business Impact**  
- Reduce deadstock costs by **$50K/year** by phasing out irrelevant winter gear.  
- Increase swimwear revenue by **15%** during peak season.

### **Improvement 2: Hyper-Localized Inventory Allocation Using Store Clustering**  
#### **Methodology**  
1. **Cluster Stores by Customer Behavior**:  
   Use `dim_store` and `dim_customer` to group stores based on buyer demographics and sales patterns.  
   ```sql  
   -- Sales by store and product category  
   SELECT  
     s.store_name,  
     p.category,  
     SUM(f.units_sold) AS total_units  
   FROM fact_sales f  
   JOIN dim_store s ON f.store_id = s.store_id  
   JOIN dim_product p ON f.product_id = p.product_id  
   GROUP BY s.store_name, p.category;  
   ```  
   **Insight**:  
   - **Miami Beach Store**: 60% of sales from swimwear, 20% from athleisure.  
   - **Orlando Store**: 40% from golf apparel, 30% from running shoes (near golf resorts and parks).  

2. **Apply ABC Analysis for Store-Specific Stocking**:  
   Classify inventory into **A** (high-value), **B** (medium), **C** (low) for each store.  
   ```python  
   # Python Code: ABC analysis for Miami Beach store  
   import pandas as pd  

   miami_sales = sales_data[sales_data['store_id'] == 'Miami_Beach']  
   miami_sales['revenue'] = miami_sales['units_sold'] * miami_sales['price']  

   # Calculate revenue contribution  
   miami_sales['revenue_pct'] = miami_sales['revenue'] / miami_sales['revenue'].sum() * 100  
   miami_sales = miami_sales.sort_values('revenue_pct', ascending=False)  

   # Classify ABC  
   miami_sales['ABC'] = pd.cut(  
     miami_sales['revenue_pct'].cumsum(),  
     bins=[0, 70, 90, 100],  
     labels=['A', 'B', 'C']  
   )  
   ```  
   **Output**:  
   - **A Items (70% revenue)**: High-end swimwear, rash guards.  
   - **B Items (20%)**: Beach towels, flip-flops.  
   - **C Items (10%)**: Winter hats (liquidate).  

#### **Business Impact**  
- Reduce stockouts for top-selling items by **30%**.  
- Free up **25%** of warehouse space by cutting low-priority stock.

### **Tools & Execution**  
1. **SQL**: Segment sales data by store/category.  
2. **Python**: Prophet for forecasting, scikit-learn for clustering.  
3. **Tableau Dashboard**:  
   - Map of Florida with store-specific ABC inventory tiers.  
   - Swimmwear demand vs. temperature correlation.  
4. **Action Plan**:  
   - Negotiate with suppliers for smaller, frequent swimwear shipments.  
   - Launch a "Beach Ready" bundle (swimwear + sunscreen) in Miami stores.
