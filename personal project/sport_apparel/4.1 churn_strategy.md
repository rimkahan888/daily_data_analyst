To address customer churn and leverage ABC analysis for targeted promotions in a retail apparel store, follow this structured approach:

### **1. Calculate Churn Rate (2022 vs. 2023)**
**Definition**:  
- **Churned Customers**: Customers who purchased in 2022 but did not return in 2023.  
- **Churn Rate**: `(Churned Customers in 2023 / Total Customers in 2022) × 100`.

**Steps**:  
1. **Identify Churned Customers**:  
   ```sql
   -- Customers who bought in 2022 but not in 2023
   WITH customers_2022 AS (
     SELECT DISTINCT customer_id 
     FROM fact_sales 
     WHERE year = 2022
   ),
   customers_2023 AS (
     SELECT DISTINCT customer_id 
     FROM fact_sales 
     WHERE year = 2023
   )
   SELECT 
     a.customer_id 
   FROM customers_2022 a
   LEFT JOIN customers_2023 b ON a.customer_id = b.customer_id
   WHERE b.customer_id IS NULL;
   ```

2. **Churn Rate**:  
   ```sql
   SELECT 
     (COUNT(churned.customer_id) * 100.0 / COUNT(total.customer_id)) AS churn_rate
   FROM customers_2022 total
   LEFT JOIN churned_customers churned ON total.customer_id = churned.customer_id;
   ```

---

### **2. ABC Analysis of Churned Customers**
**Segmentation**:  
- **A (Top 20%)**: Contributed 80% of 2022 revenue.  
- **B (Next 30%)**: Contributed 15% of revenue.  
- **C (Bottom 50%)**: Contributed 5% of revenue.  

**Steps**:  
1. **Calculate 2022 Customer Spend**:  
   ```sql
   SELECT 
     customer_id, 
     SUM(revenue) AS total_spend
   FROM fact_sales 
   WHERE year = 2022
   GROUP BY customer_id;
   ```

2. **Classify ABC Tiers**:  
   ```sql
   WITH customer_spend AS (
     SELECT 
       customer_id, 
       SUM(revenue) AS total_spend,
       NTILE(100) OVER (ORDER BY total_spend DESC) AS percentile
     FROM fact_sales 
     WHERE year = 2022
     GROUP BY customer_id
   )
   SELECT 
     customer_id,
     CASE 
       WHEN percentile <= 20 THEN 'A'
       WHEN percentile <= 50 THEN 'B'
       ELSE 'C'
     END AS abc_tier
   FROM customer_spend;
   ```

3. **Merge Churn & ABC Data**:  
   ```sql
   SELECT 
     c.customer_id,
     c.abc_tier,
     CASE WHEN ch.customer_id IS NULL THEN 'Retained' ELSE 'Churned' END AS status
   FROM abc_tiers c
   LEFT JOIN churned_customers ch ON c.customer_id = ch.customer_id;
   ```

### **3. Targeted Promotions by ABC Tier**
#### **A. Tier A (High-Value Churned Customers)**  
- **Strategy**: Personalized, high-impact incentives.  
- **Promotions**:  
  - **Exclusive Discounts**: "We miss you! Enjoy 30% off your next purchase."  
  - **Early Access**: Invite to pre-sales or VIP events.  
  - **Bundles**: "Buy one, get one 50% off on premium items you loved in 2022."  

#### **B. Tier B (Mid-Value Churned Customers)**  
- **Strategy**: Balance cost and retention.  
- **Promotions**:  
  - **Loyalty Points**: Double points on next purchase.  
  - **Seasonal Sales**: "Summer Refresh: 20% off swimwear."  
  - **Free Shipping**: Threshold-based (e.g., "Spend $100, get free shipping").  

#### **C. Tier C (Low-Value Churned Customers)**  
- **Strategy**: Cost-effective broad campaigns.  
- **Promotions**:  
  - **Flash Sales**: "24-hour sale: 40% off clearance items."  
  - **Referral Programs**: "Refer a friend, get $10 off."  
  - **Email Campaigns**: "Come back! Here’s 15% off your next order."  

---

### **4. Measure Promotion Effectiveness**  
**Metrics**:  
- **Reactivation Rate**: % of churned customers who return after promotions.  
- **Incremental Revenue**: Additional revenue from reactivated customers.  
- **ROI**: `(Revenue from Campaign - Campaign Cost) / Campaign Cost`.

**Example**:  
```sql
-- Track reactivated customers
SELECT 
  COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS reactivated_customers,
  SUM(revenue) AS incremental_revenue
FROM fact_sales 
WHERE 
  year = 2023
  AND customer_id IN (SELECT customer_id FROM churned_customers);
```

### **5. Example Output & Insights**  
#### **ABC-Churn Analysis Table**  
| ABC Tier | Total Churned | % of Total Churn | Avg. 2022 Spend |  
|----------|---------------|-------------------|------------------|  
| A        | 50            | 10%              | $1,200           |  
| B        | 150           | 30%              | $400             |  
| C        | 300           | 60%              | $80              |  

**Insights**:  
- **Tier A**: Smallest churn group but highest revenue loss. Prioritize 1:1 outreach.  
- **Tier C**: Largest churn group but low impact. Use cost-efficient mass campaigns.

### **Tools for Execution**  
1. **SQL/Python**: For data extraction and segmentation.  
2. **CRM Platforms**: HubSpot/Salesforce to automate personalized promotions.  
3. **Dashboarding**: Tableau/Power BI to visualize churn by ABC tier.  

By combining **churn rate** and **ABC analysis**, you can create a laser-focused retention strategy that maximizes ROI while preserving customer relationships. 🎯🛍️
