### **Option 1: Predictive Inventory Ordering**  
**Goal**: Use historical sales data and external factors to forecast demand and optimize stock levels.  

#### **Steps to Master**:  
1. **Demand Forecasting**:  
   - **Time-Series Models**:  
     - **ARIMA/SARIMA**: Capture seasonality (e.g., swimwear spikes in summer).  
     - **Prophet (Facebook)**: Handle holidays and promotions.  
   - **Machine Learning**:  
     - **XGBoost/LightGBM**: Incorporate features like weather, local events, or competitor sales.  
   - **Deep Learning**:  
     - **LSTM Networks**: For complex patterns in long-term data.  

2. **Data Enrichment**:  
   - **External Data**:  
     - Weather data (e.g., rainy days in Florida â†’ lower foot traffic).  
     - Local events (e.g., Miami Marathon â†’ spike in running gear).  
   - **Supplier Lead Times**: Factor in delays for reorder points.  

3. **Inventory Optimization**:  
   - **Reorder Point Formula**:  
     ```  
     Reorder Point = (Average Daily Sales Ã— Lead Time) + Safety Stock  
     ```  
   - **Dynamic Safety Stock**: Adjust based on demand variability.  

4. **Tools**:  
   - **Python**: `statsmodels` (ARIMA), `prophet`, `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow`.  
   - **SQL**: Track real-time inventory levels.  
   - **Tableau**: Dashboard for stock alerts and forecast vs. actuals.  

5. **Business Impact**:  
   - Reduce stockouts by **30%** and excess inventory by **25%**.  
   - Example: Predict demand for *Nike Dri-FIT Shorts* during Miamiâ€™s summer and auto-reorder.

### **Option 2: Customer Sentiment Analysis**  
**Goal**: Analyze social media/text data to understand customer preferences and improve retention.  

#### **Steps to Master**:  
1. **Data Collection**:  
   - **APIs**:  
     - **Twitter API**: Track brand mentions (e.g., complaints about sizing).  
     - **Instagram/Facebook**: Scrape comments using `BeautifulSoup` or `Selenium`.  
   - **Review Sites**: Extract data from Google Reviews, Yelp.  

2. **NLP Techniques**:  
   - **Sentiment Analysis**:  
     - **Pre-trained Models**: `VADER`, `BERT` (Hugging Face).  
     - **Custom Models**: Train on apparel-specific terms (e.g., "too tight", "faded color").  
   - **Topic Modeling**:  
     - **LDA/NMF**: Cluster feedback into themes (e.g., "sizing issues", "fabric quality").  

3. **Integration with Sales Data**:  
   - **Correlate Sentiment with Sales**:  
     - Example: Negative reviews about *Adidas Ultraboost sizing* â†’ dip in sales â†’ trigger a product redesign.  

4. **Tools**:  
   - **Python**: `nltk`, `spaCy`, `transformers`, `gensim`.  
   - **Cloud**: AWS Comprehend or Google NLP for scalable sentiment analysis.  
   - **Power BI**: Dashboard linking sentiment scores to product performance.  

5. **Business Impact**:  
   - Reduce returns by **20%** by addressing sizing/fabric issues.  
   - Example: Use Twitter sentiment to launch a "Perfect Fit" campaign with free size exchanges.

### **Hybrid Path: Combine Both!**  
1. **Sentiment-Driven Demand Forecasting**:  
   - Use social media trends (e.g., TikTok viral athleisure trends) to adjust inventory orders.  
2. **Promotion Personalization**:  
   - Target customers who churned due to product issues (e.g., email: "Weâ€™ve fixed the sizing! Enjoy 25% off").
