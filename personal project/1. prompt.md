  - Mention tools or techniques used (e.g., Power Query, SQL, or Excel).  
  - Include specific examples of transformations (e.g., creating calculated columns, pivoting data).  

- **Advanced Calculations (DAX)**:  
  - List key calculations or measures created using DAX or other tools.  
  - Explain how these calculations support analysis (e.g., YoY growth, profit margins).  
  - Provide examples of dynamic measures for filtering or slicing data.

- **Interactive Visualizations**:  
  - Describe the visuals used (e.g., KPIs, line charts, bar charts, maps, etc.).  
  - Explain how interactivity was incorporated (e.g., slicers, drilldowns, tooltips).  
  - Mention how the layout supports storytelling (e.g., top-to-bottom design, highlighting key insights).  

- **Storytelling with Data**:  
  - Explain how the final dashboard communicates insights effectively.  
  - Include details on dynamic titles, annotations, and how the visuals align with the business problem.

**4. Dashboard Description**:  
Summarize the dashboard’s functionality and features. Include:

**Portfolio Dashboard 1:  Interactive Sales Performance Dashboard**

* **Skills Showcased:** Data cleaning, data transformation (using Power Query), DAX calculations (measures for sales growth, YoY comparison, etc.), interactive visualizations (slicers, filters, drill-downs), storytelling with data (using clear visuals and concise insights).
* **Dashboard Description:** This dashboard analyzes sales data to provide an interactive overview of sales performance over time, broken down by region, product, and sales representative.  Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total revenue, average deal size, and conversion rates are prominently displayed, and users can interact with the dashboard to explore the data in detail.  This demonstrates proficiency in data manipulation, creating effective visuals, and translating complex data into actionable insights.

**Portfolio Dashboard 2:  Customer Segmentation and Churn Prediction**

* **Skills Showcased:** Advanced DAX, statistical modeling (using R or Python integrated with Power BI), predictive analytics, machine learning integration, visualization of complex data (e.g., heatmaps, treemaps).
* **Dashboard Description:**  This dashboard demonstrates expertise in predictive analytics by leveraging a machine learning model (e.g., logistic regression) integrated into Power BI to predict customer churn. The dashboard segments customers based on various factors (demographics, purchase history, engagement) and visualizes churn probabilities, allowing for proactive interventions to retain at-risk customers.  This highlights advanced analytical capabilities and the ability to apply machine learning to solve business problems.

**Portfolio Dashboard 3:  Supply Chain Optimization Dashboard**

* **Skills Showcased:** Data blending from multiple sources, geographical visualization (maps), KPI tracking and alerts (using Power Automate), real-time data integration, dynamic visualizations (e.g., animated charts).
* **Dashboard Description:** This dashboard focuses on supply chain efficiency. It integrates data from multiple sources (inventory management, logistics, supplier data) to provide a comprehensive view of the supply chain.  Real-time data integration keeps the dashboard up-to-date, and geographical visualizations display shipment locations.  Alerts are triggered when stock levels fall below thresholds or delays are anticipated. This demonstrates proficiency in handling diverse datasets, real-time analysis, and leveraging Power BI’s capabilities beyond static reporting.


**Portfolio Dashboard 4:  Financial Forecasting and Budgeting Dashboard**

* **Skills Showcased:**  Advanced DAX for financial modeling, creating custom visuals, report design and layout, data security and access control, integrating external data sources (e.g., financial APIs).
* **Dashboard Description:** This dashboard showcases expertise in financial modeling and budgeting.  It uses DAX to create sophisticated financial forecasts and compares them against actual results, allowing users to monitor budget performance and identify potential variances.  Custom visuals enhance the visual appeal and understanding of complex financial data.  Security features are implemented to restrict access to sensitive financial information, demonstrating awareness of data governance best practices.


**Portfolio Dashboard 5:  A/B Testing Results and Analysis**

* **Skills Showcased:**  Data visualization for A/B testing (e.g., bar charts, funnel charts), statistical significance testing, calculating key metrics (e.g., conversion rates, click-through rates), creating clear and concise reports from complex data.
* **Dashboard Description:** This dashboard visualizes the results of A/B testing experiments conducted on a website or application.  It provides a clear summary of the performance of different variations, highlighting statistically significant differences in key metrics, to inform future optimization efforts.  This showcases an understanding of A/B testing methodology and the ability to effectively communicate statistical insights through data visualization.
